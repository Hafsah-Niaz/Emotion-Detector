# Emotion-Detector
Face Emotion Recognition using Transfer Learning (TensorFlow-Keras)

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) system using Transfer Learning in TensorFlow-Keras. The model identifies human emotions from facial expressions captured in images or live video streams. 

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Uses Transfer Learning for efficient model training.
âœ… Supports real-time emotion detection using OpenCV.
âœ… Trained on the FER2013 dataset 
âœ… Emotion classes: Angry, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral, etc.
âœ… Implemented with TensorFlow-Keras and OpenCV.
